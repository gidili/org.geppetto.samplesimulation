#Sample simulation / frontend for the simulation engine for the OpenWorm project / http://openworm.org

This is a demo tailored to a very simple neuronal simulation (hodgkin-huxley single compartment no network) - just a proof of concept of the full architectural stack.

Please see installation information [available online](http://bit.ly/NBuKjd).
